# Chapter 2 - Post-It
## Response
1. What are the key benefits/emotional triggers that resulted in relatively high user engagement with this campaign?

People generally ignore and hate banner ads. But Post-It makes it as a tool that people can use and it is helpful. They put in the shoes of consumer that instead of seeing it as an ad, people see it more like a tool. People know retargeting ads and see them all the time and they generally feel annoying. But here Post-It uses the familiar technology differently. They make it helpful to consumers. Thus consumers would feel Post-It is trying to help them rather than selling them something. That generates a positive emotional trigger.

2. Is it essential for a brand to already have recognition to expect user engagement via online display advertising? Why or why not?

It is always essential for a brand to keep building and refreshing the awareness. People tend to forget things as time passes, especially in a digital world full of ads and campaigns. Traditional brands need to put in the effort to build their digital brands awareness. For this example, Post-It may want to expand its business model to digital products, but people won't aware of that if not enough digital presence is shown. Brand awareness is important to rebuild in a new domain and refresh over time. Using this retargeting campaign, people start to realize how helpful Post-It could be when it goes digital. You don't even have to log in, thanks to the cookie tracking technology behind. People only engage with Post-It brand when they know it is possible and helpful. This retargeting campaign builds that awareness.

3. The case results indicate the Post-It campaign obtained “considerable earned media reach.” What elements of this display campaign encourage these results?

The creative usage of existing banner technology surprises audiences in a good way. Also, if people like the idea, they start to talk about it and share it. Thus it creates social media posts and maybe even blog reviews about it. People talk about interesting ideas. The banner ads itself is rarely useful to the audience. So instead of feeling annoying, the user likes it and engage with the banner. What's more, a user would expect to see the banner after he/she generates his/her content. User-generated content is more encouraged to be shared in earned media. Furthermore, people would like to have it in their region when they read about this new feature. Thus would again obtain even more earned media.

Hi Michael,

Very structured thinking!

On the 2nd point, I do think sometimes it is essential, even for recognized brands. For example in the TV marketing days, FMCG like P&G still repeatedly do commercials to refresh the presence of their brands. The same thing happens now in the digital world. If you are in a competitive vertical, you would like to keep refresh the brand awareness. And for certain industry it is essential. For example, booking.com would keep retargeting you with latest hotel price that you once showed interest in, making sure that when one day you want to book that hotel, you don't think of expedia.com as the first choice.
