Why might reducing impressions have a positive impact on quality score?
- There mainly 2 reasons that reducing impressions have a positive impact. First, the ads removed to reduce impressions are those underperforming ones. Thus it improves the overall CTR, which is an important criterion of good quality score. Second, by removing underperforming ads, the remaining ones are more likely to be relevant ones. Better overall relevance also helps to improve the quality score, since quality score applies to keyword, ad group and also account level.

Nice answers Sooyong! On the second question, I think it refers to some effort that we spent in paid search can also apply to SEO. I think in this case, the key is relevance. Whether it is ranking in organic search or paid search, Google always cares much about the search quality, since it largely affects the user experience. So the effort in being more relevant can benefit both in paid search and SEO.
